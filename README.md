# Travel App

## Overview
This project was completed as a part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer course in June of 2021. 

## Functionality
This app allows a user to log a record of upcoming travel, with a picture of the destination and a temperature forecast at the travel location for the date of their departure.

## Ways to stand out
For this project, I added a "remove" option to the body cards.
